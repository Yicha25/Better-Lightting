#Better Lighting (SSR Reflections)
Enhances the visual quality of aircraft models in GeoFS by introducing Screen Space Reflections (SSR). This adds realistic, dynamic reflections of the sky, ground, and environment onto your aircraft's surfaces, significantly improving the look and feel of the simulation.

#Features
Dynamic SSR Reflections: Applies real-time reflections calculated based on the current scene and camera view.

Performance Filtering: Includes distance attenuation in the shader to automatically fade reflections on distant objects, improving performance and realism.

Integrated UI Controls: Adds controls directly into the GeoFS Advanced Settings menu for easy management.

#Installation
This add-on is distributed as a UserScript and requires a script manager extension (like Tampermonkey) to run in your browser.

Prerequisites
You need a browser extension installed that can manage UserScripts:

Tampermonkey (Recommended for Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Greasemonkey (Firefox)

#Steps
Install the Script Manager (e.g., Tampermonkey) if you haven't already.

Click the Installation Link: Click the raw script file link below. Your script manager will automatically detect the file and prompt you for installation.

Install Better Lighting (0.1.7)

Confirm Installation: Review the script details in the manager and click Install.

Restart GeoFS: Refresh or reload the GeoFS page.

Note: The script includes @updateURL tags, meaning Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey will automatically check for and prompt you to install future updates.
